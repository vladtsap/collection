# collection

> #### This project was forked from [infomate.club](https://github.com/vas3k/infomate.club)

_Collection_ is a small web service that shows multiple RSS sources on one page.

### Live URL: [collection.vladtsap.com](https://collection.vladtsap.com)

## Running it locally

The easy way. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) on your machine. Then:

```
git clone git@github.com:vladtsap/collection.git
cd collection
docker-compose up --build
```

After that navigate to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

To terminate it:

```shell script
docker-compose down --remove-orphans
```


## Running for development

Make sure you have python3 and postresql installed locally.

#### Step 1: Install requirements

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt --user
```

#### Step 2: Create a database structure

```
python3 manage.py migrate
```

#### Step 3: Take a look at [boards.yml](boards.yml)

This is the main source of truth for all RSS streams and collections in the service. All updates to the database are made through it. For the first time you can just use the existing one.

#### Step 4: Initialize your feeds

```
python3 scripts/initialize.py --config boards.yml
```

> Every time you make a change to boards.yml, just run this script again. He is smart enough to create the missing ones and remove the old ones.

#### Step 5: Fetch some articles

```
python3 scripts/update.py
```

> Don't run it too often, otherwise sites may ban your IP. There is a hardcoded cooldown interval for each feed, but you can use `--force` flag to ignore it.

#### Step 6: Run dev server

```
python3 manage.py runserver 8000
```

Then go to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) again
